A macrophage is a type of white blood cell that plays an important role in the immune system by detecting, engulfing and destroying harmful pathogens and foreign substances. Macrophages are also involved in tissue repair and regeneration, as well as in the development of the innate and adaptive immune responses. They are found in many tissues throughout the body, including the liver, lungs, spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, and brain. Macrophages can be activated by various signals, such as cytokines and chemokines, and can respond to different types of pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. They are important in both innate and adaptive immunity, and are essential for the proper functioning of the immune system.
